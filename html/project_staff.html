François Denis is a luthier in Angers, France, the author of Traité de Lutherie: The Violin and the Art of Measurement, and numerous articles on instrument design from historical principles. He is the preeminent historian of classical string instrument design, and has lectured worldwide on his investigations into design. He won the Musicora Prize in 2000 for his research on string instruments. It is Denis’s work that has in large part made the subject and the foundations of string instrument design feasible to the modern generation of luthiers.
