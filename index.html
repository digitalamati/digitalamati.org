        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The comprehensive goal of the “Digital Amati” project is to provide a usable, historically justifiable suite of software tools, and to experiment with them, in order to advance the understanding of the geometric structure inherent in the design and construction of classical string instruments. We want these tools, and creative work done with them, to be publicly accessible, and to be of use to historians, curators, restorers, and makers of these instruments. The proposed work integrates the further development of this software, its use in design, in analysis and acoustics, in manufacture, in education, and as a framework for continued research into the history and evolution of instrument forms.

        Modern luthiers—the makers of classical string instruments—are necessarily and effectively applied art historians. Their success depends on the knowledge of artistic forms having roots in classical geometry, a synthesis of science and art with parallels in architecture, furniture making, and painting. Their historical task is not only to understand, but also to create in accord with that historical idiom, and to extend the tradition with appropriate and new ideas. Imagine, by analogy, studying Vermeer as an art historian would—but also in order to paint in confluence with his idiom, and to extend it artfully and with originality. This understanding and extension—of both learning, and of making—is part of the natural evolution of art, science, and humanities.

Even so, the art of lutherie has not profoundly changed since the seventeenth century. A modern-day luthier making pilgrimage to the Museo Stradivariano in Cremona, upon seeing the tools and templates from Antonio Stradivari’s workshop, would immediately be struck by their familiarity. Concurrent and synonymous with this arrested development, significant knowledge has been lost over time. Social up- heaval and epidemic contributed to degrade lutherie’s institutional memory. New technologies made old understandings obsolete and then forgotten—an inevitable social process that surely transcends instrument making—even as vestiges of this past knowledge lingered in practice. Newly dominant notions of measure- ment and numeration pushed aside the geometric, proportional design methodology that formed the lingua franca not only in lutherie, but also in furniture making and architecture.1

        <p style="display:none">
This transition in lutherie could be described as one from the analytically classical to the romantic, the latter a liuteria da capo recapitulation of the work of Cremonese, Brescian, and Venetian masters, a sort of communication without understanding. At the same time, our notions of precision and accuracy have changed from the geometrically Euclidean to the numerically Cartesian—namely, that a circle isn’t a geometric object, but rather a generic, algebraic equation, and that precision is achieved with graph paper, measured rulers, Vernier calipers, and protractors, not with straightedge, compass and dividers. The original rules of lutherie became obscured.

        With this increased detailed knowledge of instruments, the clear challenge is to understand those first principles of design which gave rise to these classic instruments as examples of an aesthetic unity. An approach to this challenge, addressed in this proposal, is to take this recovered knowledge of design in lutherie, and to represent it in <i>programming language software</i>.

        <b>AmatiML</b> is a domain specific markup language designed to serve as an investigative tool to understand more about the history and evolution of instrument design, an inquiry we like to call “computational art history”.

        <h2>Project Staff</h2>
        <p>
        Harry Mairson (project director) is professor of computer science at Brandeis University, and an amateur violoncello maker. He received the B.A. in mathematics from Yale University in 1978 and the Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1984. The only non-professional luthier on the staff, he recently finished a violon- cello after a 1740 Montagnana, and is now working on the “forma P” Stradivari, based on the Cristiani, also described in the proposal. He has a long interest in making musical instruments, and worked as an apprentice to harpsichord maker Mark Stevenson in Cambridge, England during the late 1970s.<p>
        <p>
        Roman Barnas (project director) is director of the violin making program at the North Bennet Street School. He attended the violin making program in Zakopane, Poland at the Kenar School, also studying sculpture, drawing and painting. He continued his education at the Ignacy Paderewski Academy of Music in Poznan, graduating with honors. He then worked in Detroit for a decade as a violin restorer, before joining NBSS. He is a prizewinner from instrument making competitions sponsored by the Violin Society of America. Most recently, he collaborated with mechanical engineering faculty at MIT on analyzing f-holes of Cremonese instruments, and how they optimized acoustic power.</p>
        <p>
        François Denis is a luthier in Angers, France, the author of Traité de Lutherie: The Violin and the Art of Measurement, and numerous articles on instrument design from historical principles. He is the preeminent historian of classical string instrument design, and has lectured worldwide on his investigations into design. He won the Musicora Prize in 2000 for his research on string instruments. It is Denis’s work that has in large part made the subject and the foundations of string instrument design feasible to the modern generation of luthiers.</p>
        <p>
        Kevin Kelly is a luthier in Boston, Massachusetts.33 A maker and restorer, he has made significant contributions to geometric methods for violin design. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the North Bennet Street School in 2015, where he is on the board of advisors, and is a consultant for the Department of Musical Instruments at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</p>
        <p>
Sam Zygmuntowicz is a luthier in Brooklyn, New York, and is one of the leading violin makers in the world, having made instruments by commission for Joshua Bell, David Finckel, Yo-Yo Ma, Isaac Stern, and many other famous musicians. He was the subject of John Marchese’s book, The Violin Maker (Harper, 2007), detailing his making a violin for Eugene Drucker of the Emerson String Quartet. Winner of numerous prizes for lutherie, he is hors concours at competitions of the Violin Society of America. He was also creative director of the Strad 3D project (strad3d.org), a comprehensive artistic and acoustic study of three canonical instruments: the Plowden of Guarneri, and the Willemotte and Titian of Stradivari.
