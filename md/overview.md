<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The comprehensive goal of the “Digital Amati” project is to provide a usable, historically justifiable suite of software tools, and to experiment with them, in order to advance the understanding of the geometric structure inherent in the design and construction of classical string instruments. We want these tools, and creative work done with them, to be publicly accessible, and to be of use to historians, curators, restorers, and makers of these instruments. The proposed work integrates the further development of this software, its use in design, in analysis and acoustics, in manufacture, in education, and as a framework for continued research into the history and evolution of instrument forms.

Modern luthiers—the makers of classical string instruments—are necessarily and effectively applied art historians. Their success depends on the knowledge of artistic forms having roots in classical geometry, a synthesis of science and art with parallels in architecture, furniture making, and painting. Their historical task is not only to understand, but also to create in accord with that historical idiom, and to extend the tradition with appropriate and new ideas. Imagine, by analogy, studying Vermeer as an art historian would—but also in order to paint in confluence with his idiom, and to extend it artfully and with originality. This understanding and extension—of both learning, and of making—is part of the natural evolution of art, science, and humanities.

Even so, the art of lutherie has not profoundly changed since the seventeenth century. A modern-day luthier making pilgrimage to the Museo Stradivariano in Cremona, upon seeing the tools and templates from Antonio Stradivari’s workshop, would immediately be struck by their familiarity. Concurrent and synonymous with this arrested development, significant knowledge has been lost over time. Social up- heaval and epidemic contributed to degrade lutherie’s institutional memory. New technologies made old understandings obsolete and then forgotten—an inevitable social process that surely transcends instrument making—even as vestiges of this past knowledge lingered in practice. Newly dominant notions of measure- ment and numeration pushed aside the geometric, proportional design methodology that formed the lingua franca not only in lutherie, but also in furniture making and architecture.1

This transition in lutherie could be described as one from the analytically classical to the romantic, the latter a liuteria da capo recapitulation of the work of Cremonese, Brescian, and Venetian masters, a sort of communication without understanding. At the same time, our notions of precision and accuracy have changed from the geometrically Euclidean to the numerically Cartesian—namely, that a circle isn’t a geometric object, but rather a generic, algebraic equation, and that precision is achieved with graph paper, measured rulers, Vernier calipers, and protractors, not with straightedge, compass and dividers. The original rules of lutherie became obscured.
